# Architecture

The purpose of this file is to bootstrap human and agent context with respect to this project.

## Overview

This is a VSCode extension for interactive Agda development, targeting Agda >= 2.6.1. It communicates directly with a single long-lived `agda --interaction-json` process via stdin/stdout pipes -- this is similar to `agda2-mode.el`, the Emacs agda2-mode, which communicates with `agda --interaction` (an S-expression based protocol).

The Emacs agda2-mode and this extension are structurally parallel, except:

- We use a modified version of the Lean 4 abbreviation engine (see [Unicode input](#unicode-input) below) for Unicode input.
- The Emacs mode has some Haskell integration that we do not.
- In Emacs, highlighting is stored as buffer text properties that are lost when switching buffers. The Emacs mode uses `Cmd_load_highlighting_info` to ask Agda to re-send all highlighting for the file. We don't need this because `HighlightingManager` keeps all decoration data in memory and `reapply(editor)` restores decorations when an editor regains focus.

## `--interaction` vs. `--interaction-json`

`--interaction` responses are serialized as S-expressions that invoke Emacs Lisp functions directly:

```
(agda2-goals-action '(0 1 2))
(agda2-status-action "Checked")
(agda2-info-action "*All Goals*" "?0 : Nat\n?1 : Bool" nil)
(agda2-give-action 0 "term")
((last . 2) agda2-make-case-action '("clause1" "clause2"))
```

Some responses are wrapped with ((last . N) ...) for sequencing.

`--interaction-json` responses are JSON objects (one per line)

```
{"kind":"InteractionPoints","interactionPoints":[{"id":0,"range":[...]}]}
{"kind":"Status","status":{"showImplicitArguments":false,"checked":true}}
{"kind":"DisplayInfo","info":{"kind":"AllGoalsWarnings","visibleGoals":[{"kind":"OfType","constraintObj":{"id":0},"typ
e":"Nat"}],"invisibleGoals":[],"warnings":[],"errors":[]}}
{"kind":"GiveAction","interactionPoint":0,"giveResult":{"str":"term"}}
{"kind":"MakeCase","interactionPoint":0,"variant":"Function","clauses":["clause1","clause2"]}
```

Every object has a top-level "kind" discriminator field. Built using EncodeTCM class from Interaction/JSON.hs.

## Data flow

### Command execution

```
User keypress (Leader M L)
  → keySequence state machine advances to "leader-m", then fires agda.load
  → commands.ts: save document, build IOTCM string, enqueue
  → commandQueue.ts: send IOTCM to stdin, start collecting responses
  → protocol.ts: parse JSON lines from stdout, fire events
  → Two response paths:
      Streaming: HighlightingInfo, RunningInfo → applied immediately
      Batched: InteractionPoints, DisplayInfo, etc. → collected until "JSON> " prompt
  → commands.ts: processBatchedResponses() updates goals, shows info
```

### Highlighting

The IOTCM envelope specifies `Direct` highlighting delivery, so Agda embeds highlighting payloads inline in JSON responses (`{kind: "HighlightingInfo", direct: true, info: {...}}`). This is simpler and more reliable than the `Indirect` mode (which writes to temp files) used by the Emacs mode.

Highlighting is handled in the streaming callback so it appears progressively as Agda type-checks.

Each highlighting entry has a `[from, to]` range (1-based absolute character offsets) and a list of aspect atom names (e.g. `["keyword"]`, `["inductiveconstructor"]`), plus an optional `definitionSite` for go-to-definition.

#### Unified HighlightingManager

`HighlightingManager` (`src/core/highlighting.ts`) is the single source of truth for all highlighting state. It stores `StoredEntry` objects per file URI -- each with a `Range`, atoms, optional `definitionSite`, and a `note` string -- and derives several outputs:

1. **Semantic tokens (foreground colors)** -- `HighlightingManager` implements `DocumentSemanticTokensProvider`. VS Code pulls tokens on demand; the manager maps Agda atoms to standard semantic token types so **all foreground text colors come from the user's theme**.

2. **Decorations (backgrounds, underlines, font styles)** -- pushed to VS Code via `setDecorations`. These cover visual properties that semantic tokens cannot express, using `ThemeColor` references to custom color IDs defined in `contributes.colors`.

3. **Hover type information** -- `HighlightingManager` implements `HoverProvider`. When the cursor hovers over a token, the provider looks up the entry at that position and, if its `note` field is non-empty, returns the note as a fenced `agda` code block. Agda populates `note` with the type signature of the token (e.g. `"f : ℕ → ℕ"`), so this surfaces type information on hover without any extra round-trip to the Agda process. This mirrors the pattern used by vscode-haskell, which surfaces HLS type signatures via its hover middleware.

4. **Go-to-definition** -- definition sites are stored in each entry's `definitionSite` field, looked up by position in a registered `DefinitionProvider`.

This unified design means each highlighting entry is stored once and adjusted once when the document is edited, rather than maintaining several parallel data structures.

#### Edit adjustment

When the user edits the document, stored highlighting ranges must be adjusted to stay in sync. Two modes are supported (implemented in `src/util/editAdjust.ts`):

- **`adjustForEdits`** -- for arbitrary user edits: ranges that intersect the edited region are removed; ranges after the edit are shifted by the line/character delta.
- **`expandForGoalMarkers`** -- for the known `?` → `{!!}` expansion during load: intersecting ranges are preserved and grown rather than removed. `HighlightingManager` maintains a per-URI `pendingExpansions` map; `registerPendingExpansions(uri, ranges)` is called before the expansion edit, and `adjustForEdits` consumes matching entries to decide whether to grow or remove intersecting ranges.

### Goals

After `Cmd_load`, Agda responds with `InteractionPoints` -- a list of `{id, range}` objects identifying each hole. `GoalManager` converts these Agda ranges to VSCode ranges and applies decorations (blue background + `?N` label). As a fallback for empty ranges, it scans the document for `{! !}` delimiters.

### Undo/redo collation

When the user does give then undo, the goal decoration should disappear (matching Emacs, where the overlay is destroyed by give and not restored by undo). The problem: VS Code decomposes the undo into multiple atomic edits, and each individual edit looks like an interior-only change to `adjustRangeContaining`, so the goal survives.

The fix is **undo collation** -- collapse the multiple atomic edits into a single merged change, which crosses goal boundaries and causes `adjustRangeContaining` to remove the goal.

**Computing the merged change:** `computeSingleChange(beforeText, afterText, holeAware)` in `editAdjust.ts` diffs the full document text before and after the undo using common prefix/suffix matching. It produces one `TextDocumentContentChangeEvent` spanning the entire changed region. Both undo paths pass `holeAware=true`, which prevents the minimal diff from hiding `{!`/`!}` delimiter crossings: if the common prefix contains an unmatched `{!` and the common suffix contains an unmatched `!}`, the prefix is shrunk to before the `{!` so the change region crosses the delimiter boundary. This is needed because a give that simplifies to `?` (expanded to `{!  !}`) produces identical delimiters in the post-give text, and the undo diff would otherwise be interior-only.

#### VSCodeVim undo

VSCodeVim implements its own undo (`historyTracker.goBackHistoryStep()`) by applying each reversed change via `TextEditor.edit()`. VS Code fires a **separate `onDidChangeTextDocument` event** for each atomic change.

The extension intercepts `u` via a `contributes.keybinding` with `"when": "vim.active && vim.mode == 'Normal' && editorLangId == agda"`. This binding sits above VSCodeVim's `type` command override in VS Code's keybinding resolution order, so the keystroke never reaches VSCodeVim directly. No user configuration is needed.

Redo (`Ctrl+R`) does **not** need interception: before we can redo edit X we must have undone X, so the undo collation already removed any goals whose boundaries X crosses. VSCodeVim handles redo through its own `Ctrl+R` keybinding (which is an explicit `contributes.keybinding` registered by VSCodeVim, not routed through the `type` override).

The `agda.vimUndo` handler dispatches the `u` key back through VS Code's `type` command (`executeCommand("type", {text: "u"})`), which VSCodeVim overrides. This is exactly the path a normal `u` keypress takes (minus keybinding resolution), so VSCodeVim's undo pipeline runs through its normal task queue and state management -- preserving redo history. `executeCommand` does not go through keybinding resolution, so our keybinding does not re-fire.

The handler wraps this dispatch with collation:

1. Snapshots the document text and sets collation mode on `GoalManager`.
2. Dispatches `u` via `executeCommand("type")` so VSCodeVim runs its undo.
3. As `onDidChangeTextDocument` events fire, the handler sees the collation flag and skips `goals.adjustForEdits` (highlighting still adjusts per-change as normal).
4. `setTimeout(0)` defers final processing until straggling events drain.
5. The callback diffs the snapshot against the current text, runs `goals.adjustForEdits` with the single merged change.

The `setTimeout(0)` relies on: (a) VSCodeVim applying all mutations synchronously (no awaits between `TextEditor.edit()` calls), so all events are queued before `setTimeout` is scheduled; (b) FIFO task queue ordering.

#### Native VS Code undo

Native undo fires **one `onDidChangeTextDocument` event** with multiple `contentChanges` and `reason === TextDocumentChangeReason.Undo`. No multi-event coordination is needed.

1. The handler detects `reason === 1` (Undo) or `reason === 2` (Redo) with multiple changes.
2. `reconstructPreText(postText, contentChanges)` rebuilds the pre-change text. Content changes have ranges in pre-document coordinates; unchanged regions are copied from the post-text, and deleted content (which we don't have) is filled with null-byte placeholders.
3. `computeSingleChange(preText, postText)` diffs to get the merged change. Placeholders land inside the "changed middle" since they won't match the post-text -- the boundaries are determined by the unchanged regions, which are correct.
4. `goals.adjustForEdits` runs with the single merged change.

### Command queue

Only one IOTCM command can be in-flight at a time (Agda processes them serially, signaling completion with a `JSON> ` prompt). `CommandQueue` ensures serial execution and tracks busy state via `setContext('agda.busy', ...)`.

The queue uses a hybrid streaming/batched model:

- An `onStream` callback fires for each response as it arrives (used for highlighting and progress)
- The returned `Promise<CommandResult>` resolves after the prompt with all accumulated responses

## Info Panel

The Info Panel (`src/editor/infoPanel.ts`) is a `WebviewPanel` that replaces notification toasts as the primary information display -- equivalent to Emacs's `*Agda Information*` buffer.

### Design

Unlike Lean 4's infoview (a React app communicating over bidirectional RPC), the Agda Info Panel uses plain HTML/CSS generated on the extension side and sent to the webview via `postMessage`. The webview sends messages back only for user interactions (clicking a file location link → `openFile`). This simple design is appropriate because Agda's protocol sends complete `DisplayInfo` JSON blobs -- there are no server-side object references or interactive widgets.

### What it displays

All `DisplayInfo` response variants are routed to the panel:

- **AllGoalsWarnings**: Visible goals (`?N : Type`), invisible goals, warnings, errors
- **GoalSpecific**: Goal type with full context (`ResponseContextEntry[]`), `GoalTypeAux` (Have/Elaboration), boundary, output forms, helper functions
- **Error**: Full error messages (no truncation), with warnings
- **InferredType**, **NormalForm**, **Version**
- **CompilationOk**: Success message with optional backend name, warnings, errors
- **Constraints**, **Context**, **WhyInScope**, **ModuleContents**, **SearchAbout**, **Auto**, **Time**, **IntroNotFound**, **IntroConstructorUnknown**

### Lifecycle

- Auto-opens on first `agda.load` (in `ViewColumn.Beside`, `preserveFocus: true`)
- If the user closes it, it stays closed (not auto-reopened)
- Toggle with `agda.toggleInfoPanel` (`Leader M I`)
- Panel uses `retainContextWhenHidden: true` to preserve scroll position

## Unicode input

### Overview

Agda code uses extensive Unicode (→, ∀, ℕ, λ, etc.). The extension provides inline replacement: type `\to` and it becomes `→`, type `\all` and it becomes `∀`, etc. The abbreviation is underlined while active and replaced eagerly when the user moves the cursor away or types a non-matching character.

### Engine: Lean 4 abbreviation system

Rather than writing a custom Unicode input system, we adapted the abbreviation engine from [vscode-lean4](https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4) (Apache-2.0). The engine lives in `src/unicode/engine/` and is mostly unmodified from upstream. It provides:

- **`AbbreviationProvider`**: Loads the abbreviation table, supports prefix matching and multi-result lookup. Takes custom translations directly (a `SymbolsByAbbreviation` map) and supports `reload()` for live config changes. Also a convenient place to store the last-selected cycle index for each abbreviation with multiple mappings.
- **`AbbreviationRewriter`**: Core state machine tracking active abbreviations, deciding when to replace. Takes a leader character string and an `AbbreviationTextSource` abstraction.
- **`TrackedAbbreviation`**: Represents one in-progress abbreviation (its range, current text, matched symbols)

The VS Code integration layer (`VSCodeAbbreviationRewriter`, `AbbreviationRewriterFeature`, `AbbreviationFeature`) adapts the engine to VS Code's APIs -- listening to document changes and selection changes, applying edits, managing per-editor lifecycle. The `AbbreviationProvider` and status bar item are created once in `extension.ts` and shared between the editor rewriter and the InputBox.

### InputBox abbreviation support

When Agda commands prompt the user for input (e.g. `agda.give` with an empty goal, `agda.searchAbout`), the extension uses `showUnicodeInputBox` (`src/editor/unicodeInputBox.ts`) instead of plain `vscode.window.showInputBox`. This wraps the same `AbbreviationRewriter` engine so users can type abbreviations like `\to` → `→` inside the input box. Tab/Shift+Tab cycling is supported via dedicated keybindings gated on the `agda.inputBox.isActive` context variable.

The InputBox and editor rewriter both need to format the status bar identically (showing the current abbreviation and cycle list). This logic is shared via the `updateAbbreviationStatusBar` free function exported from `VSCodeAbbreviationRewriter.ts`. Both consumers also use the same operation-queue pattern (enqueue/drain/flush) to serialize async engine calls, though the implementations differ enough (4 op kinds vs 2 because of the limited callback API of `InputBox`) that the queue itself is not shared.

### Re-entrant edit events and the `isApplyingEdit` guard

When `workspace.applyEdit()` modifies the document, VS Code fires `onDidChangeTextDocument` **re-entrantly** -- during the `await`, before the promise resolves. Without a guard, this re-entrant event feeds our own edit into `changeInput` → `processChange`, which kills tracked abbreviations before `enterReplacedState` / `updateRangeAfterCycleEdit` can run.

**The fix**: `VSCodeAbbreviationRewriter` sets `isApplyingEdit = true` before `await workspace.applyEdit()` and `false` after. The first `onDidChangeTextDocument` event during the flag is assumed to be the re-entrant notification for our own edit and is skipped. In VS Code Remote, `applyEdit` involves IPC and takes multiple event-loop turns, so any additional events that arrive during the flag (real user keystrokes) are buffered in `eventsBufferedDuringEdit` and replayed through the operation queue after the edit completes.

#### Why `workspace.applyEdit` instead of `textEditor.edit`

The Lean 4 upstream uses `textEditor.edit()`. We use `workspace.applyEdit()` because:

1. `textEditor.edit()` has an internal retry loop (`$tryApplyEdits` → `acceptModelChanged` → retry) that can re-apply edits unexpectedly
2. `workspace.applyEdit()` is the recommended API for programmatic edits and goes through a cleaner code path

## Keybinding architecture

Two parallel keybinding styles are supported, each self-consistent:

### Ctrl+C style (Emacs-like)

Basic commands use native VS Code 2-key chords: `ctrl+c ctrl+l` → `agda.load`, etc. No state machine needed.

For 3-key sequences (`C-c C-x C-...` and `C-c C-u ...`), the chord enters a state machine state, then a `ctrl+key` binding fires the final command:

- `ctrl+c ctrl+x` → state `"cc-x"` → `ctrl+r` fires `agda.restart`
- `ctrl+c ctrl+u` → state `"cc-u"` → `ctrl+t` fires `agda.goalType` (with universalArgCount=1)

### Evil style (Doom Emacs)

VSCode only supports 2-key chords natively, and VSCodeVim captures all Normal mode keypresses. To support `Leader M L` style sequences:

1. A `contributes.keybinding` intercepts `Space` in vim normal mode for Agda files (fires before VSCodeVim's `type` override) → `agda.keySequence.leader` command
2. The key sequence state machine (`keySequence.ts`) tracks prefix state via `setContext("agda.keySequence", state)`
3. Package.json keybindings use `when` clauses: `"agda.keySequence == 'leader-m'"` gates single-key bindings like `l` → `agda.load`
4. Each Agda command handler calls `resetSequence()` to clear the prefix state

State transitions: `""` → `"leader"` → `"leader-m"` → (final key fires command) or `"leader-m"` → `"leader-m-x"` → (final key fires command).

### Shared infrastructure

Both styles share the same `universalArgCount`, `resetSequence()`, timeout (2 seconds), and Escape cancel. The states are kept separate (`leader-m-x` vs `cc-x`, `leader-m-u` vs `cc-u`) so the two styles don't bleed into each other -- each style uses its own key modifiers (plain keys for Evil, `ctrl+key` for Ctrl+C) in sub-states.

## Version handling

`AgdaVersion` (`src/agda/version.ts`) is an opaque branded type -- like `AgdaOffset`, it prevents accidental misuse by making it non-assignable to/from `number[]`. Well-known constants `V2_7` and `V2_8` are used throughout the codebase for version-gated behavior:

- **Command builders** (`commands.ts`): `cmdAutoOne`/`cmdAutoAll` take different arguments for Agda < 2.7 vs >= 2.7. `cmdLoadNoMetas` (>= 2.8) takes the filepath in the inner command; `cmdNoMetas` (< 2.8) does not. `cmdBackendTop`/`cmdBackendHole` are >= 2.8 only.
- **Location parsing** (`agdaLocation.ts`): Agda < 2.8 uses comma-separated positions (`file:10,5-15`); >= 2.8 uses dots (`file:10.5-15`).
- **Process startup** (`process.ts`): Runs `agda --version` before spawning, validates >= 2.6.1.

## Agda binary management

The extension can discover and manage Agda installations (`src/agda/installations.ts`), exposed through two commands:

- **Download Agda** (`agda.downloadAgda`): Downloads pre-built Agda binaries from a hardcoded table of known GitHub release URLs for the current platform (linux/x64, macOS-arm64/x64, win64). Archives are cached in `globalStorage/archives/` and extracted to `globalStorage/bin/{tag}/`. Handles two archive layouts: v2.8.0+ (bare `agda` at root) and v2.7.0.1 (`Agda-*/bin/agda`). On macOS, removes the quarantine extended attribute.
- **Switch Agda** (`agda.switchAgda`): Shows a QuickPick listing Agda installations from four sources (discovered in parallel) and updates the `agda.path` configuration:
  1. **Extension-managed** downloads in `globalStorage/bin/`
  2. **User-configured** `agda.additionalPaths` -- broken entries are shown with a warning icon and reason
  3. **System PATH** -- scans `$PATH` directories
  4. **Well-known locations** -- `~/.cabal/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, `~/.ghcup/bin`, `~/.nix-profile/bin`, Nix system profile, plus Homebrew paths on macOS and `%APPDATA%\cabal\bin` on Windows

All discovery functions return normalized paths (symlinks resolved) to ensure correct deduplication across sources. The shared `probeAgda()` helper checks executability and runs `agda --version` to detect the version, returning a structured `ProbeResult` (success with version, or failure with reason).

`AgdaProcess` auto-detects `Agda_datadir` for v2.7.0.1 bundled installs so the data directory is found correctly when using a downloaded binary.

## Location parsing

Agda error messages contain source locations like `file:10,5-15` or `file:10,5-12,3`. The `agdaLocation.ts` module parses these into structured `LinkedText` -- an array of plain-text and location segments. This enables clickable file locations in the Info Panel.

Column numbers require conversion because Agda reports code-point offsets while VS Code uses UTF-16. The parser reads the referenced file's text to perform this conversion accurately. Goal-relative ranges (no filepath) are left as plain text since they refer to the current document's already-known goal ranges.

## Offsets and positions

Agda uses 1-based absolute code-point offsets for all positions. Two layers handle conversion:

1. **`offsets.ts`** -- pure functions with zero VS Code dependencies. `AgdaOffset` is a branded opaque type that prevents passing raw numbers to `document.positionAt()`. Handles supplementary-plane characters (U+10000+), where each code point maps to two UTF-16 code units.

2. **`position.ts`** -- thin wrappers that accept a `TextDocument` and delegate to `offsets.ts`. Functions take an optional `text?: string` parameter to avoid repeated `document.getText()` calls in loops.

## Configuration

`src/util/config.ts` provides typed helpers for reading `agda.*` settings: `getAgdaPath()`, `getExtraArgs()`, `getBackend()`, `getAdditionalPaths()`, `getGoalLabels()`, `getInputEnabled()`, `getInputLeader()`, `getInputLanguages()`, `getCustomTranslations()`. The generic `agdaConfig()` helper wraps `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("agda")`.

Available settings: `agda.path` (binary), `agda.additionalPaths` (for Switch Agda), `agda.extraArgs`, `agda.backend` (GHC/JS/LaTeX/HTML), `agda.goalLabels` (show `?N` decorations), plus `agda.input.*` settings for the abbreviation engine.

## TextMate grammar

`syntaxes/agda.tmLanguage.json` provides a minimal TextMate grammar that scopes comments, block comments, and string literals. Its only purpose is to tell VS Code's bracket matcher to skip brackets inside these regions -- without it, parentheses in `-- comment (with parens)` would be bracket-matched. All actual syntax coloring comes from Agda's semantic tokens.

The line comment rule uses a negative lookbehind to avoid matching `--` inside identifiers: `(?<![^\s(){}";@.])--.*$`. This is a double-negative ("not preceded by a non-delimiter") derived from Agda's lexer, where the delimiter characters that cannot appear in identifiers are whitespace, `(){}`, `"`, `;`, `@`, and `.`. Since Agda allows almost any Unicode character in identifiers (the `alexGetByte` function in the compiler maps non-ASCII printable characters to identifier-compatible bytes), enumerating delimiters is simpler than enumerating identifier characters.

## Build and test

Begin by running `npm ci`.

The extension is bundled with **esbuild** (`esbuild.js`): `src/extension.ts` → `dist/extension.js` as CommonJS (required by VS Code), with `vscode` as an external. `--watch` mode is available for development.

Tests use **vitest** (`vitest.config.mts`) with a mock VS Code API (`test/__mocks__/vscode.ts`). Run with `npm run test`. Tests cover offsets, positions, edit adjustment, goals, highlighting, cursor positioning, info panel rendering, abbreviation engine, InputBox abbreviation support, version comparison, location parsing, and outline parsing.

`scripts/generate-abbreviations.py` regenerates `src/unicode/abbreviations.json` from Agda's Emacs input method by driving Emacs in batch mode to dump the `agda-input` translation table.

## Outline (Document Symbol Provider)

`src/editor/outline.ts` implements `vscode.DocumentSymbolProvider` for Agda, populating the VS Code **Outline** panel and breadcrumbs without requiring a running Agda process.

### Parser (`parseAgdaSymbols`)

The parser operates on the raw text of the file using a single linear pass:

1. **Comment stripping** (`stripComments`) -- removes line comments (`--`) and nested block comments (`{- ... -}`) before matching. Nested depth is tracked so `{- {- ... -} -}` works correctly.

2. **Line matching** -- each comment-stripped line is classified by its first non-whitespace token:

   | Pattern                                                                               | Kind emitted                                   |

   | `<name> :` (type signature)                                                           | `definition` (→ `SymbolKind.Function`)         |
   | `<name> =` (equation clause)                                                          | `definition`, updating line to the last clause |

3. **Block signature tracking** -- `postulate`/`primitive` start a block: subsequent indented `<name> :` lines are consumed as members of that block until indentation returns to the block's level.

4. **Data/record block tracking** -- when a `data` or `record` declaration is matched, the parser enters a `dataRecordBlock` at the declaration's indentation level. Any line more indented than that level is considered inside the block:
   - Inside a `data` block: `<name> : …` lines are emitted as `constructor`.
   - Inside a `record` block: `constructor <name>` lines are emitted as `constructor`; a `field` keyword opens a `fieldBlockIndent` sub-block where subsequent indented `<name> : …` lines are emitted as `field`. An inline `field <name> : …` is also accepted.
   - The block ends when indentation returns to or below the opening declaration's level.

5. **Deduplication** -- function signatures and clause definitions are kept in a `Map` keyed by name. Signatures record the first occurrence; equation clauses overwrite with the last occurrence (so the symbol points to the final defining equation rather than the type signature, which aids navigation to the implementation).

6. **Reserved word filtering** -- `RESERVED_HEAD_TOKENS` lists all Agda keywords that can legally begin a line but are not declaration names (`open`, `import`, `where`, `with`, `let`, `infix`, `rewrite`, etc.), preventing false positives.

### DocumentSymbolProvider (`AgdaOutlineProvider`)

`AgdaOutlineProvider.provideDocumentSymbols` converts `ParsedAgdaSymbol[]` into `vscode.DocumentSymbol[]` with two levels of nesting:

**Module nesting** (`currentModule`):

- Module symbols are pushed as top-level entries and become the current module.
- Non-module symbols that aren't constructors/fields are added as children of the nearest preceding module.
- When a new `module` declaration is encountered, it becomes the new current module.
- Symbols before any module declaration appear at the top level.

**Data/record nesting** (`currentParent`):

- `data` and `record` symbols become the current parent (in addition to being added to the module or top level).
- `constructor` and `field` symbols are added as children of `currentParent` rather than directly to the module.
- When a `definition` or `postulate` symbol is encountered, `currentParent` is reset to `null` so subsequent definitions are siblings of the data/record, not children.
- A new `data` or `record` replaces `currentParent`, so each type owns only its own members.

Example structure:

```
module M             ← top level, currentModule = M
  data Nat           ← M.children, currentParent = Nat
    zero             ← Nat.children (constructor)
    suc              ← Nat.children (constructor)
  record Pair        ← M.children, currentParent = Pair
    _,_              ← Pair.children (constructor)
    fst              ← Pair.children (field)
  f                  ← M.children, currentParent = null (definition)
```
